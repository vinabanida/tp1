 * The controller deals with the user pressing the "User Step" button widget being click.  If also
 * supports the user click on the "Quit" button widget.
 * 
 * The class has been written assuming that the View or the Model are the only class methods that
 * can invoke these methods.  This is why each has been declared at "protected".  Do not change any
 * of these methods to public.</p>
